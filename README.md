This is an incomplete list of things that make me curious about life. It makes me realise there might be more to it than pure coincidence. These make me want to dig deeper.

### math

### paradoxes

- Paradox of Effort. You have to put in more effort to make something appear effortless.
- Paradox of Persuasion. The most argumentative people rarely persuade anyone. The most persuasive people don't argue; they observe, listen, and ask questions. Persuasion is an art that requires a paintbrush, not a sledgehammer.
- Paradox of Wisdom. "The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know." - Albert Einstein. The more you learn, the more you are exposed to the immense unknown.
- Paradox of Choices. The more choices we have, the more difficult it becomes to choose.
- Paradox of Perfectionism. The goal to reach perfectionism, becomes a barrier to reach the goal, or not even start the task at hand. The goal should be to iterate continuously, tending towards perfection.

### pyschology

#### motivation

Whenever I find something interesting, which makes me curious about math, philosophy, psychology, etc, it makes me want to dig deeper, I usually save them on random memory addresses of my brain cells, Notes or Telegram's Saved Messages. However, it was getting difficult to keep a track of thoughts. So, why not create a single source-of-truth.
