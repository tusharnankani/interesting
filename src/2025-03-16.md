Hi, I want you to understand the below context and question me if you don't understand any thing. Make sure you understand the work cycle properly and question it if you don't.  

"We build regulatory reports in excel/xml/pdf formats.

Every regulator has different requirement and a different template. As a developer, I automate these reports by writing a SQL to get the data. 

Then we pass that SQL to a Pentaho based framework written internally. In that, we write rules and validation in a file called Report Config. This file has rules and validations - validates each row of data (initially received from the SQL) and gives an intermediate excel/json/parquet that has all data and has additional columns whether the row is reportable or not. If not, it has exceptions and comments, why it is not reportable. This has two use cases: 
1. We as developers use the intermediate file (JSON/Parquet) for our further calculations and computations. 
2. The Intermediate Excel is used by Operations to see the data, exceptions, raw values, etc 

After that, we perform certain, very complex aggregations using that intermediate file. Post that, we render into the template file given by regulator. All of this is done using Pentaho jobs and transformations. Rendering is done using Excel Writer steps. 

Version of Pentaho: 7.0

Briefly, this is the flow:

Input: 
1. Date for the report to be generated
2. Template by the regulator

Build: 
1. A SQL query first that gets the data in a model we want it to be, such that it is easier to integrate to perform calculations  
2. A report config file where we write additional helper columns, exceptions rules, reportability rules, etc

(Note: there may be multiple SQL sourcing data from multiple sources. Each dataset will require separate rules and reportability logic. They may be clubbed later in Pentaho for Aggregation/Rendering)

Next: This pipeline generates an intermediate file - Excel, JSON/Parquet
The intermediate file is used for two final steps - Aggregation followed by rendering. 

Output: 
1. Intermediate Files
2. Final report output"

I want you to take enough time to understand my current workflow and ask me if you have nay questions

### GPT Questions

```
Thanks for the detailed explanation! I want to make sure I fully understand your workflow before proceeding. Here are a few questions:  

1. **SQL Data Model**  
   - You mentioned that the SQL query is structured in a way that makes integration and calculations easier. Can you give an example of how the data is structured? Are there any common transformations applied to the raw data before it reaches Pentaho?  

2. **Report Config File**  
   - What format is the report config file? Is it XML, JSON, or something else?  
   - Are the rules and validations written in a structured way (like using a DSL or predefined format), or are they more free-form?  

3. **Validation & Reportability**  
   - How does the validation process work? Do you use predefined rules per regulator, or is there a standard rule set that applies across multiple regulators?  
   - If a row is marked as "Not Reportable," is there an override mechanism where Operations can manually adjust the data, or is it strictly enforced?  

4. **Aggregation Complexity**  
   - When you say the aggregations are complex, is it because of multi-step calculations, dependencies between different datasets, or handling large volumes of data?  
   - Do you use Pentahoâ€™s built-in aggregation steps, or do you write custom scripts for certain parts of the aggregation logic?  

5. **Rendering the Final Report**  
   - Since different regulators have different templates, do you have a predefined mapping between the intermediate file and the final template, or do you create a new mapping for each report?  
   - Are the templates mostly static (fixed layouts), or do they have dynamic elements like conditional formatting, variable column structures, etc.?  

6. **Pentaho Version 7.0**  
   - Since Pentaho 7.0 is an older version, do you face any limitations or challenges with it? For example, performance issues, lack of certain features, or compatibility problems?  

Once you clarify these, Iâ€™ll have a clearer picture of your workflow. Let me know if any of these questions need more context! ðŸ˜Š
```

### My Answers

```
Q1: Can you give an example of how the data is structured? Are there any common transformations applied to the raw data before it reaches Pentaho?

My response: For example, there is a trade table. A trade has multiple version and events. My query would get the latest version based on eligible events. Next, let us we want to instrument details, we will join with instrument table and get the latest instrument details. So on and so forth. 

Q2.1: What format is the report config file? Is it XML, JSON, or something else?

My response: It is Excel. It has a predefined structure and format to it. 

Q2.2: Are the rules and validations written in a structured way (like using a DSL or predefined format), or are they more free-form?

My response: It uses Drools Validation Engine.

Q3.1: How does the validation process work? Do you use predefined rules per regulator, or is there a standard rule set that applies across multiple regulators?

My response: These rules are more data specific. For example: a row cannot be reportable if NIC code is not present. Regulator doesn't worry about this, these validations are double checked by Operations if the exclusion was appropriate and ideal. 

Q3.2: If a row is marked as "Not Reportable," is there an override mechanism where Operations can manually adjust the data, or is it strictly enforced?

My response: That is a good question. Let me think... In some reports it may be possible to adjust the data. Essentially that modifies our intermediate files, runs the validations again and the remaining pipeline of Aggregation and Render. But again, we would like to minify adjustable columns since trade data should not have manual intervention. That brings me to a point I might have missed, we can configure this in the Report Config - i.e. which columns are adjustable, which are not. 

Q4.1: When you say the aggregations are complex, is it because of multi-step calculations, dependencies between different datasets, or handling large volumes of data?

My response: All actually, it can get complicated very easily. 

Q4.2: Do you use Pentahoâ€™s built-in aggregation steps, or do you write custom scripts for certain parts of the aggregation logic?

My response: Flexible. Based on developer's decision.

Q5.1: Since different regulators have different templates, do you have a predefined mapping between the intermediate file and the final template, or do you create a new mapping for each report?

My response: No mapping as such, We use excel writer steps to render data. 

Q5.2 Are the templates mostly static (fixed layouts), or do they have dynamic elements like conditional formatting, variable column structures, etc.?

My response: The format may be static (like specific cells, or top 5) or dynamic like reporting all trades that match reporting criteria

Q6: Since Pentaho 7.0 is an older version, do you face any limitations or challenges with it? For example, performance issues, lack of certain features, or compatibility problems?

My response: Yes, there are bottlenecks. Migration to 9.0. Moving to AWS is difficult with Pentaho.

### GPT Counter questions

```
Thanks for the detailed responses! I now have a much clearer understanding of your workflow. Just a few final clarifications to ensure I have the full picture:  

1. **Intermediate File Adjustment & Reprocessing**  
   - You mentioned that some reports allow Operations to adjust data in the intermediate file, which then triggers re-validation and subsequent processing.  
   - **Question:** How is this adjustment tracked? Do you maintain a version history of the intermediate files, or is it overwritten each time?  

2. **Drools Validation Engine**  
   - Since you use Drools for validation, I assume the validation logic is defined as rules within the engine.  
   - **Question:** How often are these rules updated? Do developers manually update the rules in the report config file, or is there a centralized rule repository that multiple reports can reference?  

3. **Excel Writer for Rendering**  
   - You mentioned that the final report is generated using Pentahoâ€™s Excel Writer step. Since different reports have different formats (some static, some dynamic),  
   - **Question:** How do you handle dynamic row expansion in Excel? For example, if the number of reportable trades varies, do you use a predefined section in the template that expands, or does the Excel Writer dynamically insert new rows as needed?  

4. **Pentaho Migration & AWS**  
   - You mentioned that migration to Pentaho 9.0 and AWS is a challenge.  
   - **Question:** Is the difficulty mainly due to legacy dependencies, lack of support for cloud-native features, or something else (e.g., cost, effort, business approval)?  

I really appreciate your patience in answering these! This helps me fully grasp your setup before moving forward. ðŸš€
```

## My answers 2.0 

```
These are all great questions: 

1. Question: How is this adjustment tracked? Do you maintain a version history of the intermediate files, or is it overwritten each time?

Answer: These are tracked in our database, yes. I don't have much visibility here.

2. Question: How often are these rules updated? Do developers manually update the rules in the report config file, or is there a centralized rule repository that multiple reports can reference?

Answer: Rules are rarely updated. Once the report logic is written and test reports are validated, rarely there is a flaw in the logic. Mostly there are data issues at max. 

The rules are manually update in report config. One file for each report. 

3. Question: How do you handle dynamic row expansion in Excel? For example, if the number of reportable trades varies, do you use a predefined section in the template that expands, or does the Excel Writer dynamically insert new rows as needed?

Answer: Dynamically inserts new rows.

4. Question: Is the difficulty mainly due to legacy dependencies, lack of support for cloud-native features, or something else (e.g., cost, effort, business approval)?

Answer: Legacy, yes.

Asking LLM to prepare a context in such a way an LLM understands it

```
Perfect, now you understand my entire setup 
I want you to create a context for me

This context includes all details about what we have shared in this chat
```

### Context - 1st try

```
### **Overview**  
At my work, we build regulatory reports in **Excel, XML, and PDF** formats. Each regulator has different requirements and templates. As a **developer**, my role is to automate these reports by writing SQL queries to extract the required data and then process it using an internally developed **Pentaho-based framework**.  

### **Workflow Breakdown**  

#### **1. Input**  
- **Report Date** â€“ The date for which the report is generated.  
- **Regulator Template** â€“ Each regulator provides a specific format that we must adhere to.  

#### **2. Data Extraction & Transformation**  
- **SQL Queries:** We write SQL queries to extract relevant data in a structured format that facilitates integration and further calculations.  
  - Example: A trade table has multiple versions and events. We extract only the latest valid version of each trade based on event eligibility.  
  - We also join other datasets like the **instrument table** to enrich trade data.  
- **Multiple SQLs:** Different datasets may come from multiple SQL queries, each requiring separate **reportability rules** and validation logic.  
- **Data Model Goal:** The extracted data should be structured in a way that makes validation and calculations easier.  

#### **3. Validation & Reportability Rules**  
- **Report Config File:** This is an **Excel-based** file that contains predefined rules and validations for each report.  
- **Validation Engine:** We use **Drools** to enforce validation rules.  
- **Rule Examples:**  
  - If the **NIC Code** is missing, the trade is marked **Not Reportable**.  
- **Operations Involvement:** Operations teams review the intermediate files and verify if exclusions were appropriate.  
- **Adjustments:**  
  - Some reports allow manual **adjustments** to specific columns in the intermediate file.  
  - Configured in the Report Config fileâ€”some columns are **adjustable**, while others (like trade data) are **strictly enforced**.  
  - If adjusted, the intermediate file is reprocessed, triggering re-validation and further processing.  

#### **4. Intermediate File Generation**  
The pipeline generates an **intermediate file** in one of the following formats:  
- **Excel** â€“ Used by Operations to review data, exceptions, raw values, etc.  
- **JSON/Parquet** â€“ Used for further calculations and computations.  

#### **5. Aggregation & Computation**  
- **Complex Aggregations:** The intermediate file undergoes **multi-step calculations** with dependencies between datasets.  
- **Pentaho Flexibility:**  
  - Developers decide whether to use **built-in aggregation steps** or **custom scripts**.  
  - Aggregations can be **very complex** due to multi-layered computations, data dependencies, and large volumes.  

#### **6. Report Rendering**  
- **Pentahoâ€™s Excel Writer:** The final report is generated using **Excel Writer steps** in Pentaho.  
- **Handling Different Templates:**  
  - **No predefined mapping** â€“ Data is rendered directly into the template format.  
  - Some reports have **static layouts** (fixed cells), while others require **dynamic row expansion** based on data.  
  - The Excel Writer dynamically inserts new rows for reports with variable record counts.  

### **Challenges & Limitations**  
1. **Pentaho 7.0 Bottlenecks** â€“ Older version, leading to potential performance issues.  
2. **Migration Hurdles** â€“ Moving to **Pentaho 9.0** and AWS is difficult due to **legacy dependencies**.  
3. **Scalability** â€“ Handling large volumes of trade data efficiently.  
4. **Manual Adjustments** â€“ Balancing **data integrity** vs. **Operations' need for flexibility**.  

```

### Final tuning

Thanks, now I want you to prepare this context slightly more "developer requirement" oriented
I want an LLM to understand this context and help me prepare a Java based framework replacing this framework on Pentaho

# Developer-Oriented Context: Regulatory Reporting Framework  

## Objective  
The goal is to replace the existing Pentaho-based regulatory reporting framework with a Java-based framework that automates report generation, validation, aggregation, and rendering while maintaining flexibility for multiple regulator-specific templates.  

## Current Workflow & Requirements  

### 1. Input Data & Extraction  
#### Requirements:  
- Extract trade data and related information from multiple sources (SQL databases, APIs, files, etc.).  
- Ensure only the latest valid version of each trade is retrieved based on event eligibility.  
- Perform enrichments via joins with other datasets (such as instrument details).  
- Handle multiple SQL queries per report, supporting different data models and data sources.  
- Provide a mechanism to define, store, and modify extraction queries (SQL or alternative approaches like ORM).  

#### Technical Considerations:  
- Support for JDBC-based SQL execution or JPA/Hibernate ORM for structured extraction.  
- Batch processing capability for large datasets (potentially using Spring Batch or Apache Spark).  

### 2. Validation & Reportability Rules  
#### Requirements:  
- Implement a validation engine to check data quality and reportability rules.  
- Rules should be configurable per report and not hardcoded in Java.  
- Validation logic should allow:  
  - Field-based validation (for example, NIC Code is mandatory).  
  - Row-based validation (for example, trade must have a valid counterparty).  
  - Cross-row or dataset-level validation (for example, trade exposure calculation).  
- Validation output must include:  
  - Whether each row is reportable or not.  
  - Exception messages explaining why a row is not reportable.  
- Some fields should be adjustable by Operations, triggering re-validation and reprocessing.  

#### Technical Considerations:  
- Use Drools or an alternative rule engine such as MVEL or Easy Rules.  
- Configurable rules file (JSON, YAML, or database-stored rules) instead of static code.  
- Allow UI-based rule modifications for Operations if needed.  

### 3. Intermediate File Generation  
#### Requirements:  
- Store validated data in an intermediate format for further processing.  
- Support multiple formats:  
  - JSON / Parquet for calculations and further processing.  
  - Excel for Operations review.  
- Maintain a version history of intermediate files in a database for tracking.  

#### Technical Considerations:  
- Use Apache POI for Excel processing.  
- Use Jackson or Gson for JSON serialization.  
- Use Apache Parquet or Avro for high-performance storage.  

### 4. Aggregation & Computation  
#### Requirements:  
- Support complex multi-step aggregations and computations.  
- Handle dependencies between datasets, such as trade-level aggregation to portfolio-level.  
- Support both predefined and dynamic aggregations based on regulator requirements.  

#### Technical Considerations:  
- Use Java Streams, Apache Spark, or Apache Flink for large-scale aggregations.  
- Aggregation logic should be configurable and modular using YAML/JSON configs or a rule engine.  
- Support custom Java-based aggregations if needed.  

### 5. Report Rendering (Excel, XML, PDF)  
#### Requirements:  
- Map intermediate data to regulator-specific templates.  
- Support static and dynamic templates:  
  - Static templates with predefined cell locations.  
  - Dynamic templates with variable rows (for example, reporting all trades that match criteria).  
- Use an equivalent of Pentahoâ€™s Excel Writer for rendering reports.  
- Ensure Excel formulas, formatting, and conditional logic remain intact.  

#### Technical Considerations:  
- Use Apache POI or JExcelAPI for Excel reports.  
- Use JasperReports or iText for PDF generation.  
- Use JAXB or StAX for XML rendering if required.  

## Challenges in Current System & Migration Considerations  
### 1. Legacy Pentaho 7.0 Bottlenecks  
- Performance issues as Pentaho 7.0 is not optimized for large-scale processing.  
- Limited cloud support, making it difficult to migrate to AWS or cloud-based solutions.  
- Rigid data processing, as Pentahoâ€™s pipeline-based transformations lack flexibility.  

### 2. Migration Goals for the Java-Based Framework  
- Fully replace Pentaho jobs and transformations with a Java-based pipeline.  
- Enable scalability and parallel processing via multi-threading, Spring Batch, or Apache Spark.  
- Allow configurable workflow definitions using JSON/YAML instead of hardcoded Pentaho transformations.  
- Deploy to AWS or cloud using Kubernetes, Docker, and cloud storage such as S3 and RDS.
